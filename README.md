# LRU Optimal Cache Simulator

## 

### This project implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) Optimal Cache Simulator. It simulates cache access based on a given sequence of cache operations and outputs the result as HIT/MISS along with the total number of hits and misses

</br>

## Features

</br>

### 1.Simulates an LRU and Optimal cache based on a given sequence of cache operations

</br>

### 2.Determines cache hits and misses for each operation

</br>

### 3.Provides the total count of cache hits and misses

</br>

## Usage

</br>

### 1.Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and prerequisites installed (if applicable)

</br>

### 2.Run the project by executing the main program

</br>

### 3.Provide the input sequence of cache operations

</br>

### 4.The simulator will process each cache operation and determine whether it results in a HIT or a MISS

</br>

### 5.The simulator will display the result of each operation (HIT/MISS) along with the total number of hits and misses finally
