# LRU & Optimal Cache Simulator ðŸŒŸ

## Overview

This project implements a **Least Recently Used (LRU)** and **Optimal Cache Simulator**. It simulates cache operations based on a sequence of inputs and outputs whether each operation is a **HIT** or a **MISS**, along with the total count of hits and misses.

---

## Features

- ðŸ’» **Simulates** both **LRU** and **Optimal** cache strategies.
- ðŸ“Š **Tracks** cache **hits** and **misses** for each operation.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Displays** the final total of hits and misses after all operations.
- âš¡ Optimized for performance with **O(1)** hit detection using a **Node-based structure** for the LRU cache.

## Usage

1. Make sure the necessary dependencies are installed (Java environment).
2. Run the program and provide the sequence of cache operations.
3. The simulator will process each operation, displaying **HIT** or **MISS**.
4. View the total number of **cache hits** and **misses** after the simulation.
